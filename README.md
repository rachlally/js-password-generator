# JS Password Generator
An application to generate random passwords

## Description

I built this project to better understand how JavaScript allows users to interact with the web browser.  To better understand this process, the exercise was to create a function using JavaScript that generates a secure password, based on a series of prompts the user answers. The information gathered generates the password and displays it on the web brower.  It solves the always present problem of needing to create a unique password (when all you can think of is your pet's name with the year you were born).  

I learned the basics of JavaScript including functions, methods, and alerts/prompts/confirms. I better understand the ways varibles can be used in functions and how functions are the building block of .  Methods including for loops, allow for codes sets to be read Alerts/prompts/confirms are basic methods to allows users to interact and contribute information to the web browser.   

## Usage

To generate a random password, the uesr must load the page at: DEPLOYED SITE

User will click the "Generate Password" button on the landing page.  There will then be at least one alert followed by a series of prompts that this user must confirm to accept or cancel to decline.  The prompts allow the user to determine password length, and special characters of the password including: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.  The generated password will appear in the box.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
